# Order-Summary-Challenge
This is frontendmentor.io newbie challenge. 
This project is based on HTML5, CSS3 with media query to make responsive site for Mobile 375px and Desktop 1440px screen width.
This is my first front end challenge since I have started my new journey in learning for past 2 weeks.
It took me 4 hrs to make initial layout and 2 days for final touch-ups which I was stucked in the styling the <div> with class="order-box"
but, I completed it using <table>.
My next aim is to style more effectively using <div> and CSS-flex.
